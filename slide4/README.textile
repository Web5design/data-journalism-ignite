h1. Slide 4: Principal component analysis and eigenfaces

"Eigenfaces":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface are a common tool in the computer vision problem of facial recognition. They also look super creepy and cool.

Thyr are generated using a technique called "principal component analysis":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis which is a dimensionality reduction trick often used in data mining and machine learning. It's included here because it represents some of the more nontraditional techniques that data journalists have begun to adopt.

h2. The data

The data is a handful of pictures of "Phil Meyer":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Meyer found on Google image search.

h3. The code

The code is modified from another eigenface "implementation":http://osdir.com/ml/python-numeric-general/2008-03/msg00458.html found on several online message boards.
