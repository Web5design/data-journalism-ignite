categorical data continuous data places practical purposes limits values preserves fine differences example difference annual income 32 456 one 32 460 categorical data sort things bins public opinion surveys example usually use four five categories represent possible incomes categorical data often convenient handle convenience comes cost losing information start assume continuous data commonly found government reports census economic statistics later chapters cover categorical data commonly found public opinion surveys figuring rate one way build comparison number convert rate procedure

going less 100 sixty year comparison value base year smaller value comparison year dow industrial average increased 1100 percent increase 1100 percent mean another way express would say industrial average 11 times greater october 1989 october 1929 recommend usage easily confused 11 times great case 1989 dow 12 times great 1929 dow simple explanation confusion times greater compares base value difference amount greater times great compares base value new value 1989 number 2759 84 12 times 1929 figure 230 07 11 times difference clear enough think unfortunately many news writers think use times greater times interchangeably meant thing consider example atlanta journal constitution washington assault gun 20 times likely used crime conventional firearm according study atlanta journal

detrend figures taking effect inflation one barrier lack good statistical indicator inflation common one consumer price index bureau labor statistics created world war runaway prices especially ship
